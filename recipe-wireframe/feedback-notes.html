                Mainly pick a different paragraph font because it's a little hard to read
            </li>
            <li>
                Maybe add something after instructions so it doesn't just end. Everything else looks really good!
            </li>
            <li>
                I don't know if you can fix this but the two pictures look pretty different (are they different variations?)
