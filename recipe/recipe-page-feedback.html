        <h1> Recipe Page Feedback </h1>
        <ul>
            
            <h2> Person 1: </h2>
            <li>
                The font for descriptions is a bit difficult to read. (But since people would be reading the text before actually using the recipe, this would not be a huge issue)
            </li>
            <li>
                "Cook Time" is sent to next line, so the uniformity is broken. Maybe using smaller font to fit all three bold information text in single line would give more consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Instruction section has checkboxes, but because all the steps are supposed to be followed in sequence, giving numbers to each step might be more easier for users to follow.   
            </li>
            
            <h2> Person 2: </h2>
            <li>
                Maybe create checkboxes for the ingredients too?
            </li>
            <li>
                This is really picky but maybe create a section for optional ingredients (tomato, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sour cream) 
            </li>
            <li>
                The 6 under servings should be on the same line as "15 min" and "40 min"
            </li>
            
            <h2> Person 3: </h2>
            <li> Maybe try different fonts for the header and subheaders. </li>
            <li>
                Move the nutrition info section to the left to match the ingredients section or vice versa to make it consistent.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maybe add checkboxes to the ingredients section ot maybe even bullets to make it more consistent with the directions section
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
