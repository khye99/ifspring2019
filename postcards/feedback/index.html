        <h1> Feedback for Michaela </h1>
        <h2> Aesthetics:</h2>
        <p> 1. I like the consistency of the images. </p>
        <p> 2. The design is minimalistic and very straightforward. I understand the color theme you're going for but maybe having some kind of `pop` of color could make it more interesting. </p>
        
        <h2> Structure: </h2>
        <p> 1. I really like the red words on the third picture.</p>
        <p> 2. For the first and third pictures for browser, the black background seems like it's cropping out the image too much. The images are already in back and white, maybe it's okay to keep more of the image and less black background, or consider making the black have a bit of transparancy. Pure black makes the image seem a bit too dark. </p>
        <p> 3. I do like the contrast. Since the pictures are black and white, the words do stand out.</p>
        
        <h2> Technical:</h2>
        <p> 1. Consider making text bigger for second image</p>
